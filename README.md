# Pokemon-Space-Invaders
 This is my first project from the General Assembly course
 
# Overview
For the first project of the SEI Course, the assigned task was to create a fully functioning browser-based game from a short list of arcade games which included Space Invaders.

I opted to go for Space Invaders and include my own twist which of course was Pokemon, a game I played growing up. 

By following the rules of Space Invaders, the objective is simple. Defend Charizard by defeating Blastoise, Dragonite and his Trainer ðŸ™ƒ (just me being funny). 

Feel free to enjoy playing the game at: https://kirtanp8.github.io/Pokemon-Space-Invaders/
