# Project-1 Pokemon-Space-Invaders
 Implementing my love for Pokemon into the popular arcade game Space Invaders ðŸ‘¾
 
# Overview
For the first project of the SEI Course, the assigned task was to create a fully functioning browser-based game from a short list of arcade games which included Space Invaders.

I opted to go for Space Invaders and include my own twist which of course was Pokemon, a game I adored growing up. 

By following the rules of Space Invaders, the objective is simple. Defend Charizard by defeating Blastoise, Dragonite and his Trainer ðŸ™ƒ (just me being funny). 

Feel free to enjoy playing the game at: https://kirtanp8.github.io/Pokemon-Space-Invaders/

# Development Process

**Planning** 

After choosing Pokemon Space Invaders as my game, I thought I should create a checklist using Trello having used it in a workplace to plan day to day tasks. I must say that there is something rather satisfying about ticking off boxes :laughing:. 

Below is a copy of my checklist attached (I unticked them all for the screenshot).

**Creating the Grid**

I used a for loop to create the grid which allowed me to avoid writing out 121 div elements in HTML and then I was able to allocate a size to each div using CSS. 

```
function createGrid() {
  let gridArray = []
    for (let i = 0; i < 121; i++) {
      gridArray.push(i)
  }
  const grid = document.querySelector('.grid')

  gridArray.forEach((className) => {
    const newCell = document.createElement('div')
    grid.appendChild(newCell)
    newCell.classList.add(className)
  })
  }
```

**Movement**

For the game, I needed to create moving elements:  
* A Shooter (Charizard) that can shoot bullets (flamethrower) :fire:
* Multiple Enemies (Pokemon) to defeat whilst they move from side to side shooting bullets till they reach the bottom.

**Enemies** 

The enemies are assigned their starting positions with indexes on the grid.
```
enemyArray =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
```

With the below function, I can then add any pokemon with the use of the second parameter in their starting positions. 

```
function addEnemy(arr, pokemon) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (!enemyDestroyed.includes(i+1)) {
    allCells[arr[i]].classList.add(pokemon)
  } 
}
}
```
**Shooter Movement**

When adding and testing the function below, my game was starting to feel like an actual game as I could move the Shooter from side to side and then of course the `fireShot()` function allowed me to shoot but it was implemented in a little later on.

```
function handleKeyUp(event) {
  const key = event.keyCode
  if (key === 39 && index !== 120) {
  removeCharizard(index)
    index++
  } else if (key === 37 && index !== 110) {
  removeCharizard(index)
    index--
  } else if (key === 32) {
    fireShot()
  } else {
    return 
  }
  addCharizard(index)
  }
 document.addEventListener('keyup', handleKeyUp)

```

**Shooting Bullets + Collision Detection**

Writing the below function was definitely a fun problem to solve. I needed a function that could move bullets up towards the enemy and then remove them if they are hit by the bullet. To do this, I first implemented a `setInterval` method which allowed me to control the speed of the bullets movement and then every millisecond each bullet would then move vertically up the grid and I did this by deducting the bullets starting position by `-= 11` because each row is eleven blocks wide meaning block `88` would be below block `77`.

Once the bullet is in enemy territory and hits one, I used `allCells[temp].classList.remove(pokemonHit)` to remove the pokemon from the grid, increase the players points using a function and function declaration but only after finding out which pokemon has been hit through an `if` statement. The reason I needed to do this was because my game had **3 Levels** with each level having a different pokemon to hit. 

```
function fireShot() {
  shotPosition = index
  let temp = shotPosition
  let pokemonHit = ''
  let shootFlame = setInterval(() => {
  if(temp >= 0 && temp <= 120) {
    allCells[temp].classList.remove('flame') 
    if (temp <= 10) {
      setTimeout(allCells[temp].classList.add('flame'), 1000)
      allCells[temp].classList.remove('flame')
    } 
    else {
      temp -= 11
      allCells[temp].classList.add('flame')
      if(allCells[temp].classList.contains('trainer')) {
        pokemonHit = 'trainer'
      }
      else if(allCells[temp].classList.contains('venasaur')) {
        pokemonHit = 'venasaur'
      }
      else if(allCells[temp].classList.contains('gengar')) {
        pokemonHit = 'gengar'
      }
      else if(allCells[temp].classList.contains('blastoise')) {
        pokemonHit = 'blastoise'
      }
      else if(allCells[temp].classList.contains('dragonite')) {
        pokemonHit = 'dragonite'
      }
      setInterval(() => {
      if(allCells[temp].classList.contains(pokemonHit)) {
        let defeatedEnemy = enemyArray.indexOf(temp)
        enemyDestroyed.push(defeatedEnemy + 1)
        allCells[temp].classList.remove(pokemonHit)
        setTimeout((allCells[temp].classList.remove('flame')), 600)
        updatePoints()
        updateScore() 
        clearInterval(shootFlame)
        temp = false
        }
        }, 100)
        }
      }
    }, 100)
    return 
  }
```

**Moving the Enemies**

I managed to get the enemies to move but prior to the code below I had a massive switch statement which didn't look appealing and was an easy way out of solving the problem. The enemies only move when Level 3 commences, I did this so Level One and Level Two would be much easier.

I have added some notes to explain the reasoning for my code. 

```
function moveEnemy() {
  if (levelThreeReady) { //A Boolean value determining whether level two has finished**
  movePokemon = setInterval(() => {
    isLeftEdge = enemyArray[0] % 11 === 0 //Checks which enemy is furthest to the left
    isRightEdge = enemyArray[enemyArray.length - 1] % 11 === 10 //Checks which enemy is furthest to the Right**
    removeEnemy(enemyArray, 'trainer') //Removes them from their current Position

//The below checks whether enemies are colliding with the border on the right
  if (isRightEdge && goingRight) {
    for (let i = 0; i < enemyArray.length; i++) {
      enemyArray[i] += 11 + 1
      movement = -1
    goingRight = false
       }
  }

//The below checks whether enemies are colliding with the border on the left**
  if (isLeftEdge && !goingRight) {
    for (let i = 0; i < enemyArray.length; i++) {
      enemyArray[i] += 11 - 1
      movement = 1
    goingRight = true
       }
  }
 
//The for loop below then moves the enemies to the next block respictively
  for (let i = 0; i < enemyArray.length; i++) {
    enemyArray[i] += movement
  }

    addEnemy(enemyArray, 'trainer')

// If the Enemy reaches the bottom row, the below function ends the game and stops the movement.
  for (let i = 0; i < enemyArray.length; i++) {
    if (enemyArray[i] >= 110) {
    clearInterval(movePokemon)
    clearInterval(moveTrainer)
    gameOver()
    removeEnemy(enemyArray, 'trainer')

    if (playerPoints === 8100 || playerPoints <= 5300) {
      clearInterval(movePokemon)
      removeEnemy(enemyArray, 'trainer')
    }
  }
  }
  }, speed)
   if (!levelThreeReady) {
    clearInterval(movePokemon)
    clearInterval(trainerShoot)
    removeEnemy(enemyArray, 'trainer')
   }
 }
}

```
# Styling

I went for a simple design, but it looks really good because of the game themed font I found + the use of Pokemon gifs which move and make the game more visually appealing. On top of this, I implemented some audio clips which I recorded myself, I added one there which represents my silly sense of humour (not to be taken seriously of course) but I was aiming to do my best impression of the EA Sports intro but of course make it relevant to my game at the same time. 

# Challenges

Getting the game to restart without using the `window.location.false(reload)` was a challenge to solve, however this was created by myself through a lack of thorough planning, I had to make a few re-arrangements in my code and chop and change things around, and I realised I could of saved myself sometime had I spent more time planning my functions and writing better Pseudocode.

# Wins

* Solving problems and bugs was a massive win for me too! It's one of the reasons I joined the course in the first place, to get me ready for industry practice.
* However, the biggest win has to be improving my JavaScript knowledge. I've been coding since March 2020 and hadn't relly come across much DOM Manipulation, learning how to create the grid using JavaScript, moving a character with keyboard buttons and learning about collision detection.
* Creating a game with three levels is something I can be proud of. I also shared my game with my friends on social media and recieved a great amount of attention (more than I usually get) which was a good feeling.

# Future Additions

* Add Levels 4 and 5**
* Create a LeaderBoard using local storage

# Key Learning Points 

* Debugging: throughout the time of me making the project and making it flow, I was coming accross hurdles such as bullets being thrown when they were not meant to or bullets still traveling once they have fallen off the grid, I was able to prevent this using `clearInterval`. However, overcoming small bugs like this were a big win for me and probably gave me a small taste of what is to come throughout my career.
* Pseudocode: Put more time into planning and you can save yourself a lot more time.
